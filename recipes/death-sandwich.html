    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Death Sandwich is the flagship product of Death Kwon Do Pizza and Subs.The recipe was created in an ancient dojo thousands of years ago, and was a closely guarded secret. Eventually, Sensai took the recipe and made it into a commercial product, and thus his master holds a grudge.</p>
    <p>The sandwich, true to its name, will kill the consumer if not eaten correctly. One must wear cut-off jean shorts and a mullet in order to eat it safely. Therefore, customers of Death Kwon Do Pizza and Subs must sign a waiver to not sue the restaurant if they eat the sandwich incorrectly, and against leaving the sandwich unattended for consumption by those unaware of the implications.
